# fa21-cs242-project

 The project : fa21-cs242-project (week1) consists of python modules and classes  
 that include functions to take care of many of the core functionalities  
 of web scraping, transferring data to an external database, and creating our own API.  
 The scraper class utilizes the Beautiful Soup Library to be able to scrape data  
 off of the website op.gg and retrieves desired information in a nice format.  
 The Database Python Module utilizes the MongoDB Database services and stores data  
 that has been fetched by the scraper class mentioned above.  
 The api module has taken care of all types of API requests including (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).  
 Finally, the 20 required unit tests have been written inside the test module and test various  
 aspects of the code including scraper, API, and database functionality.
